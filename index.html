    <h1>My Last holiday!</h1>
    <p>It was a month trip to Dubai. I was with my family it was fun and very terrifying experience. First week we were just having a lot of fun. We were swimming everyday going to some roller coasters, pools, water slides. At the 2nd week we were in Disney park we were having a lot of fun and then we wanted to try out the fastest roller coaster. We were waiting 1 hour to get In the roller coaster but it was worth it! Then I got ill (I had corona virus but I didn’t know it) but it wasn’t that bad It got better in 2 days while I was sick my sister and Abdumalik got me a toy the bad part is when Abdumalik got ill but his experience wasn’t that good. <br><br>

         He had very bad time was lying in his bed all day and wasn’t eating anything but it got worse! Because he wasn’t eating he had not enough vitamins etc.
        It got even worse to the point when he wasn’t eating at all and then his body didn’t have enough calcium and started to curl up. He was in hospital for 2 days because of this. It wasn’t that good because of that accident…
